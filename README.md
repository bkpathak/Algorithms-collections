## Implementation of Algorithms in Python

This is the collections of Algorithms and Data Structure in Python.

### Dynamic Programming

Each of the DP problems are implemented using

1. Recursion
> Recursion uses brute force approach(Greedy) to search for all the possible solutions.

2. Top-Down (Memoization)
> Instead of calculation same sub-problems multiple time memoization stores the the solutions that are already computed.

3. Bottom-Up
>  The bottom-up approach builds the solution in a incremental way solving the sub-problems.

List of DP problems:

1. [Array Partition](array_partition.py)
2. Catalan Number
3. Coin Change
4. Coin Play
5. Edit Distance
6. Knights Tour
7. Longest Common Subsequence
